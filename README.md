A tool to manage Pilates Sessions

## The Problem

The attendants do not want to loose classes. Instead they want to be able to notify if they cannot attend one class so they can recover it another day. To do this they need to know when there is a spot they can take.

They want some kind of application that allows them: 

* Keep track of the classes they have to attend and the classes they have missed and can recover another day.
* Visulize the available spots and to book one.
* Release a class they have to attend so they spot can be used by anyone else and they do not miss the class day.

The administrator of the Pilates studio want to have control over:

* The clients and the classes they have left.
* The activities and groups that are offered.
* The attendants of a given class and the changes that happen in every class.
